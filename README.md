## Step to run

### Wordpress Only

- If you are using port `8080`/`8082`, change them in the docker-compose.yml
- If you changed the port `8080`, replace all `8080` to the port you use in `db.sql`
- Run `docker-compose up -d`
- The db.sql is automatically imported for you!
- Browse http://localhost:8080/
- Browse http://localhost:8080/wp-admin to add post
- Oh the admin login is ben2613 / 12345678
### Vue App

- If you changed the port `8080`, edit the `VITE_API_URL` at `vue-app/.env` correspondingly
- Go `vue-app`, Run `yarn & yarn build` or `npm i & npm run build` to build the project into `dist` folder
- Browse http://localhost:8081/ to VueJS App fetching WordPress API

You may change to use `wordpress` docker image just in case you do not trust the image I used for debugging

### Clean up
- run `docker-compose down`
- run `docker volume ls` to find the volume created here, it should start with project name and end with _wordpress and _db
- run `docker volume rm <volumn name>` for these two volumes
- delete this repo directory

You may see lots of error popping up in your editor / IDE as I do not map the whole wordpress folder to local drive, thus the intellisense cannot find the Wordpress built-in function.

But they are too big to include to a repo and break part of the reason we use docker image I guess
